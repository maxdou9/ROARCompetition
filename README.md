# ROAR_Competition

Submission for the 2025 Fall ROAR Racing competition by Max Dou

## Requirements

Requires `progress` module and ROAR_PY

## Time spread

Unofficial time over 10 runs:

- Average: 321.73 seconds
- Fastest: 321.55 seconds
- Slowest: 322.00 seconds


> [!NOTE]
> Run-to-run variance can cause crashes or cause a slower or faster time. Repeated testing with debugCompetitionRunner.py is recommended to filter out outliers.

## Implemented trail braking system seen in #experimental-code. Unfortunately, such a system would require the readjusting of several waypoints, something that I simply do not have the time needed to do so. I hope that in the future someone may be able to adjust the algorithm, as I feel it is the next major time save opportunity.
